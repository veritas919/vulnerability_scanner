# vulnerability_scanner

This repo provides a script, vulnerability_scanner.py, that can flag potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in a Python codebase. 

<br/> 
To use this tool, a developer should:

1) Download vulnerability_scanner.py, found in this repo
2) Place the vulnerability_scanner.py file in the folder for their repo's backend
3) While in the backend folder, run "python vulnerability_scanner.py" on the command line

The scanner will start running and, soon after, print SQL injection vulnerabilities, separated by file name, to the command line.

An example of the output can be found in the images folder, labelled "flagged_vulnerabilitites.PNG" <br/> 
If "set()" is printed next to the file name, that means there were no found vulnerabilities in that file <br/> 
Otherwise, a set whose elements are vulnerable code segments will be displayed next to the corresponding file name 

Tests corresponding to the scanner can be found in test_vulnerability_match.py. Feel free to run these tests. The results of a test run can be viewed in the "flagged_vulnerabilities.PNG" file in the images folder.
